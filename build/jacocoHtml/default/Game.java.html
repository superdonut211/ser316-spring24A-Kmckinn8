     * 4.0 This guess was already used
     * 4.1 Guess includes symbols, numbers (not just letters or one letter)
     * 5. After 10 guesses the game ends and is set to game over
     * 5.1 If the player keeps guessing even though the status is not InProgress
     *
     * The returned answer and the guess needs to be added to the respective lists for tracking.

     * If letter:
     *  Return 1.NumOfOccurrence, 1.0 for the letter not being in the word, 1.1 for being in there once etc.
     *  Add points according to NumOfOccurance

     * If word (go by this order of checks):
     *  If word is correct return 0.0 and add points based on the length of the word (e.g. dog - 3 points, horse - 5 points), set game status to won
     *  If word is incorrect but has correct length return 2.0 and add 1 point
     *  If word is incorrect and is partially included in the word return 3.0 and add 2 points
     *  If word is too long or too short return 2.1, 2.2 accordingly and reduce points based on how off the word is (e.g. how many letters off)
     *
     * For either:
     *  Guess was already used, reduce points by 2 and return 4.0 (checked before 4.1 error). Guess still counts toward made guesses.
     *  Guess includes numbers/symbols etc. (so more than just letters) reduce points by 3 and return 4.1, the guess is still added to the list of guesses
     *
     *
     * Score can also be negative, that is no problem.
     * When the player guessed 10 times and did not guess the word set the game to game over (status) and return 5.0 (no matter if there was another error).
     * If the player guesses again, even though game status is won or game over return 5.1.
